    summary: Starts a transaction on a path
    description: Starts a transaction on a path in the database by returning its current value, locking it until the _finish_ endpoint is called. NOTE this API endpoint is also available through the websocket connection, which is the preferred method. This API endpoint is provided for clients not supporting websockets, and those that don't have a websocket connection by choice or because of network limitations.
