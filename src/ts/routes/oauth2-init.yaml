    summary: Starts an OAuth2 flow
    description: Starts a 3rd party OAuth2 authentication flow. This allows a user to sign in (and sign up) using an external auth provider such as Facebook, Google etc. The client app has to call this endpoint to get an url to redirect the user to kick off the OAuth2 flow. If the client is already authenticated, the external account will be linked to the existing user. The provider used must have been added to the server configuration with `server.configAuthProvider(provider, config)`. In the Javascript client, this OAuth2 flow can be kicked off with `client.auth.startAuthProviderSignIn(provider, callbackUrl, options)` or (browser only) `client.auth.signInWithRedirect(provider)` which uses the current url as `callbackUrl`.

        description: The url to redirect the user to after they successfully authenticated, or canceled. If the signin is successful, this url is called with a `result` query parameter (eg `https://my.website.com/oauth2/callback?result=eufy3f73gfvjbwe314f...`) that can be used by the AceBase client to finish the OAuth2 flow with `client.auth.finishAuthProviderSignIn(result)`, or `client.auth.getRedirectResult()`. If the signin fails, this url will be called with query parameters `provider`, `error`, and optionally an additional `reason` and `description`, eg `https://my.website.com/oauth2/callback?error=canceled&reason=user_canceled&description=The+user+canceled+the+auth+request`
